The unmasking of NRIC numbers has allowed criminal syndicates to profile, target, and exploit victims with frightening precision.</p>    <p>Despite this severe failure, no PAP minister has faced accountability. Meanwhile, opposition leader Pritam Singh has been charged and convicted in a process led by a biased committee composed of five PAP ministers, who voted 5-1 against him, proving once again that the government uses its power to crush opposition while protecting its own members from scrutiny.</p>    <p>This event exposes the dangers of one-party dominance, reinforcing the urgent need for a stronger opposition to prevent such abuses of power.</p>    <!-- Phase 1 -->    <button class="collapsible"> Phase 1: The Cybersecurity Breach & Data Exposure (December 2024)</button>    <div class="content">        <p>In a staggering security failure, ACRA mistakenly unmasked NRIC numbers on its Bizfile portal, making personal identification numbers freely accessible to anyone.</p>        <img src="https://www.singaporescammer.site/assets/nric2.png" width="100%" alt="NRIC Breach">        <p>Cybercriminals wasted no time, scraping the database and compiling profiles of high-value targets.</p>        <p>One prominent victim was a wealthy businesswoman and NTUC member, who was unknowingly put at risk by the very government that was supposed to protect her data.</p>        <p>With personal data now easily available, criminals could launch precise, targeted attacks that were nearly impossible to detect.</p>    </div>    <!-- Phase 2 -->    <button class="collapsible"> Phase 2: Scammers Gain Inside Information (January 2025)</button>    <div class="content">        <p>With highly sensitive NRIC numbers now exposed, scammers strategically identified their victims:</p>        <img src="https://www.singaporescammer.site/assets/nric3.png" width="100%" alt="Scammer Planning">        <p>By cross-referencing NRICs with banking records, affiliations, and transactions, they pinpointed wealthy individuals and those affiliated with government-linked organizations like NTUC, CPF, and HDB.</p>        <p>They discovered the woman was a former NTUC member and used this insider knowledge to impersonate NTUC staff, gaining her trust effortlessly.</p>        <p>Before the ACRA breach, scammers had to guess who to target.
